If you're seeing this message: you probably imported the project correctly!


A text file like this is extremely useful in coordinating tasks in coding a robot, especially
when you have multiple people working on a single file.
You can use a tracking system like below to keep track of tasks, or create your own!

Task 1 - DONE (Bugs fixed by Omar)
Task 2 - IN PROGRESS (Wheel code added by Austin; Viper slide code added by Nick)
Task 3 - NOT STARTED


When working with GitHub, it's important to remember 3 things: 1) Always fetch origin before
beginning to work to ensure you have the latest updates from your group, 2) always push your code
to origin after your work is complete, and 3) Try and communicate any changes you made to your
group. If two of you are working on one file at the same time and try and commit, you'll get what's
known as a merge conflict. It shouldn't be too hard to solve though, GitHub should prompt you to
choose which changed you want to actually keep.

Make sure you're communicating with the engineers too on what you need from them, and whether they
need anything from you.


For the purposes of this Half-Scrimmage, the goal is to get you involved with working with the robot.
This not only means you're comfortable with coding parts you already know, but extending your
knowledge to new challenges. Because of this, I'd highly recommend NOT using or referencing code you
previously wrote, and trying to make new code.
If you are unsure of what to do at any time, Learn Java for FTC is a great start. Be smart though; the
book is too massive to read completely searching for one answer, so use the table of contents wisely.


Other than that's you're ready to start!
(P.S. right click the TeleOp folder and select Java Class to create a new file.)
